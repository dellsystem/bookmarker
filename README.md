![Bookmarker](https://github.com/dellsystem/bookmarker/raw/master/static/bookmarker.png)

A personal project to help me retain information from the books I'm reading. 

Currently only supports a single user, but I plan to extend it to support
multiple users eventually.

Demo
----

You can view a read-only active demo at <http://dellsystem.bookmarker.me>. This
is also a great way to creep on what books I'm reading.
